This repository contains the code needed to play the Treasure Hunt game.

Version 1 of the code for the Demo 2 text version can be found under the "Demo 2 Text based game" Branch of the repository.

To run this code, download all eight class flies: Excutable.java, Coordinate.java, Maze.java, Player.java, Time.java, Items.java, Mummies and Score.java.

Run the Executable.java class. 

This version of the code allows the player to use the WASD keys on their keyboard to navigate the maze that also has a mummy that obeys the layout of the maze walls which moves as a result of randomized, valid movements. 

The code also keeps track of the user's score which is thusfar only effected by the time it takes to complete the code. 

The code does have a coded-out region that makes collectable items, albiet the items do not their effecst assigned yet.

Also see the Demo 2 GUI version in the branch "Demo 2 GUI version" Branch of the repository. 

To run this code, download all seven class flies: ECoordinate.java, Maze.java, MazeGUI.java, Player.java, Mummies.java, MummyTimer.java, and AlertBox.java.

Import all classes into the application package. 

Also download the nine png files (ugandaU.png, ugandaD.png, ugandaR.png, ugandaL.png, mummyRIGHT.png, mummyLEFT.png, mummyUP.png, mummyDOWN.png, and imageWin.png) and the application.css and import them to src.

This version of the code allows the player to use the WASD keys on their keyboard to navigate the maze that also has a mummy that obeys the layout of the maze walls which moves as a result of randomized, valid movements. 

When the player wins, an alert box appears telling they have won. 

Run the MazeGUI.java class. Enter a desired length and width (should be equal), PRESS ENTER, and the "play button". It is important to press enter before pressing the play button as it will first create the maze, and the Play button will make a GUI version of that maze.
