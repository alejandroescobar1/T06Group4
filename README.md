Tutorial 06 Group 4 Repository

This repository contains the code needed to play the Treasure Hunt game.

Version 1 of the code for the Demo 1 can be found under the "Version_1-Demo_1" Branch of the repository.

To run this code, download all six class flies: Excutable.java, Coordinate.java, Maze.java, Player.java, Time.java, and Score.java.

This version of the code allows the player to use the WASD keys on their keyboard to navigate the maze.

They will not be allowed to walk through walls and will win once they reach the end.

The code also keeps track of the user's score which is thusfar only effected by the time it takes to complete the code.
